## Introduction

Cocowah Coins is a personal finance management application that transforms how users track and understand their spending through AI-powered features. The application combines bank account integration with advanced receipt scanning technology to provide granular, item-level expense tracking - something traditional finance apps have historically failed to deliver.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and integrated with OpenAI and AWS Textract, Coins delivers a comprehensive solution for detailed expense management while maintaining an intuitive user experience.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Existing personal finance applications fail to provide the granular level of expense tracking needed for truly informed financial decision-making. When conducting market analysis of solutions like Mint and YNAB, a clear gap emerged:

- While these platforms offer budgeting and expense tracking through bank integrations, they only capture merchant-level transactions
- Users cannot easily track what specific items they purchased within each transaction
- This lack of detail forces many financially-conscious individuals to resort to cumbersome spreadsheets

This problem became particularly evident during major life changes such as relocation, when understanding exactly where money is being spent becomes critically important.

### Target Users

Through research, we identified several key user segments who would benefit most from our solution:

1. **Tech-savvy Millennials reaching financial milestones**
   - Characteristics: Mobile-first, career-advancing, home-buying, starting families
   - Needs: Comprehensive financial overview, seamless integration with lifestyle

2. **Average-income households focused on budgeting**
   - Characteristics: Cost-conscious, inflation-impacted, fixed-income
   - Needs: Realistic budgeting tools, potential savings identification, price comparison

3. **Immigrants new to the country (0-4 years)**
   - Characteristics: Unfamiliar with local finance systems, settling down
   - Needs: Financial guidance, intuitive interface with minimal learning curve

4. **Former Mint users seeking alternatives**
   - Characteristics: Experienced with digital finance tools, need data migration
   - Needs: Familiar workflow with enhanced capabilities

## UX Process

### Research & Discovery

The project began with extensive market analysis and user interviews to understand pain points with existing solutions. Key findings revealed:

- A clear demographic divide in finance management approaches: older users preferred manual paper entry, while younger users favored digital solutions
- Frustration with the lack of itemized transaction data in current apps
- Strong desire for automation balanced with control over categorization
- Need for secure receipt storage for warranties, returns, and tax purposes

### User Journey Mapping

I mapped the typical finance management journey, identifying key friction points:
- Manual data entry causing abandonment
- Difficulty maintaining consistent categorization
- Inability to track spending patterns at a granular level
- Challenges retrieving historical purchase data when needed

### Ideation & Concept Development

Working from these insights, I developed a value proposition canvas that aligned user jobs, pains, and gains with potential solutions. This led to our core concept: AI-powered receipt scanning that extracts item-level data, automatically categorizes purchases, and provides personalized financial insights.

### Prototyping & Iteration

The design process involved multiple stages:

1. Low-fidelity wireframes exploring different information architecture approaches
2. Technical prototyping of the AI receipt scanning capability using DocTR and GPT APIs
3. High-fidelity mockups created in Figma for key user flows
4. Interactive prototypes for user testing

Each iteration was refined based on feedback and usability testing.

## Design Solution

### Core Features

Coins addresses user needs through several key innovations:

#### 1. Intelligent Receipt Scanning

The centerpiece of the application is the ability to extract and structure content from receipts at an item level. By simply uploading a photo of a receipt, users get:
- Automatic extraction of merchant, date, and total amount
- Item-by-item breakdown with individual prices
- Smart categorization based on purchase history and item recognition
- Secure digital storage for future reference

#### 2. Multi-Level Categorization System

Transactions are organized in a hierarchical system that provides meaningful context:
- **Sections:** Broad categories like "Food & Dining"
- **Shelves:** Sub-categories like "Groceries" or "Restaurants"
- **Boxes:** Specific item types like "Produce" or "Dairy"

This approach enables more realistic budgeting and deeper spending insights.

#### 3. Seamless Bank Integration

Using Plaid webhooks, Coins synchronizes transactions from users' bank accounts:
- Automatic transaction importing
- Smart matching with scanned receipts
- Reconciliation of bank data with manual entries
- Real-time update notifications

#### 4. AI-Powered Financial Assistant

The integrated chat feature allows users to:
- Ask natural language questions about their spending
- Receive personalized financial advice
- Get insights about spending patterns and trends
- Compare prices across different merchants for similar items

### User Interface Design

Key design principles included:
- **Clarity:** Making complex financial data easily scannable
- **Hierarchy:** Prioritizing information based on user needs
- **Consistency:** Maintaining visual patterns across different sections
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring the app works for users with varying abilities

### UI/UX Design System

To ensure consistency and maintain design quality throughout the application, I developed a comprehensive design system for Coins. This system provided the foundation for all UI components and visual elements.
