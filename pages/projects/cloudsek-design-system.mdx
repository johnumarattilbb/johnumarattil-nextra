# Welcome to CloudSEK Design Systems Journey!
CloudSEK is a Digital Risk Management company committed to creating innovative products and digital experiences to prevent and remediate cyber threats. As the Sr. UI/UX designer, I had the opportunity to lead the development of the CloudSEK Enterprise Design System from scratch. This system was essential to support our growing range of products and to streamline collaboration across teams.

## The Need for a Design System

CloudSEK's expanding suite of products necessitated a unified design approach to maintain consistency, improve efficiency, and enhance user experience. A design system would not only provide a single source of truth but also ensure that our brand identity and design principles were consistently applied across all platforms.

# Scope of Design System V2
The CloudSEK Design System V2 encompassed several critical elements:

* CloudSEK Design Principles
* CloudSEK Brand Guidelines
* Color Principles
* Grid/Layout Guidelines
* Typography
* Components

## CloudSEK Design Principles

> These principles form the foundation of our design system. They guide our team when working on different parts of the system and help us make better and more informed decisions.

1. Put User Needs First

We prioritize the needs of the people who use our products. Our goal is to enhance their day-to-day and long-term work through exceptional user experiences, making their interactions with our products more efficient and enjoyable.

2. Strive for Consistency, Not Uniformity

Consistency is key to familiarity. We use the same language and design patterns wherever possible, ensuring a seamless user and developer experience. However, we also recognize the need for flexibility to adapt to specific contexts without sacrificing coherence.

3. Default to Openness

Transparency is essential in everything we do. Sharing our progress and processes not only increases visibility and accountability but also drives us to maintain high-quality standards. Open communication fosters collaboration and trust within our team and with our users.

4. Make It Accessible

Inclusivity is at the core of our design philosophy. Our services are designed for everyone, meeting the accessibility standards outlined in WCAG 2.1. We ensure that people with diverse needs can use our products without barriers, creating an equitable experience for all.

5. Provide a Good Developer Experience

A positive developer experience is crucial to our success. Our tools and systems are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, enabling developers to get started in minutes. We focus on reducing friction and streamlining processes to boost productivity and innovation.

6. Automate Everything You Can

Efficiency is our priority. We continuously seek opportunities to automate repetitive tasks and testing, saving time for our colleagues, users, and our future selves. Automation allows us to focus on more meaningful work, improving overall productivity and quality.

## CloudSEK Brand Guidelines

> Here, you’ll learn how to express our brand and follow our design philosophy to uniquely distinguish us from our competitors.

### The CloudSEK Logo
The CloudSEK logo is composed of the “together” logomark and a logotype set in Armin Grotesk. The horizontal version is the primary logo and should be used in all external applications.

#### Logo minimums
Small logo rules apply when the logo is below 100px wide for digital and 26mm wide for print. The logo lockup should not go below 50px/14mm wide. The singular mark can go as small as 25px × 25px or 7mm × 7mm and for a favicon, 16px × 16px.

### Logomark
The CloudSEK logomark is visually inspired by the concept of cell division, symbolizing the rapid growth of data in the world. On closer inspection, the cell division imagery reveals a central attraction, representing the idea of togetherness and the unification of growing data, with CloudSEK providing protection.

This idea of togetherness is pivotal. It illustrates two sides working as one. For customers and end users, it conveys the seamless integration of our products to enhance productivity and communication. It embodies our commitment to delivering an exceptional experience in identifying, investigating, and mitigating cyber risks.

On a deeper level, the logomark represents a broader concept of change and innovation, underscoring our mission to continuously evolve and improve in the cybersecurity landscape.

### Usage Guidelines

Primary Colors: Use CloudSEK Blue and Light Blue for main branding elements such as the logo, headers, and key graphics.
Secondary Colors: Use Grey and Light Grey for backgrounds, secondary elements, and text. White is used for text and background to maintain clarity and readability.
Typography
The typography in our logo is set in Armin Grotesk, chosen for its bold and modern look that aligns with our brand's identity. For other branding materials, follow these guidelines:

### Font Family
Primary Font: Roboto
Secondary Font: Roboto

### Usage Guidelines
Headlines: Use Roboto for headlines and important text to ensure it stands out.
Body Text: Use Roboto for body text to maintain readability and a clean look.
Font Sizes: Maintain a hierarchy of font sizes to create a clear and organized layout. Use larger sizes for headings and smaller sizes for body text.

## CloudSEK Color Principles
### Use Colors Intentionally
Colors should be used to communicate and guide users, not merely for decoration. CloudSEK’s color palette is designed to draw attention to important elements and information, facilitating a user-friendly experience.

### Utilize Color Roles
CloudSEK has a curated set of colors assigned for specific roles within the interface. Consistent use of these colors for text, status indicators, buttons, and navigation aids in user recognition and understanding of the interface’s components.

### Ensure Accessibility
All color applications within CloudSEK’s products adhere to WCAG 2.1 level AA standards, ensuring a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text. This commitment to accessibility guarantees that the products are usable by people with visual impairments and enhances readability for all users.

### Applying CloudSEK Colors to Interfaces
Primary Colors: CloudSEK Blue (#2F7FA4) and Light Blue (#BBE9FF) should be used in primary branding elements like logos, headers, and essential graphics.
Secondary Colors: Dark Grey (#283238) and Medium Grey (#495A63) serve as background colors, secondary elements, and text, while surface-white background(#FFFFFF) ensures clarity and readability.

### Typography Guidelines
Headlines: Use Roboto for headlines to capture attention.
Body Text: Roboto is recommended for body text due to its clean appearance and legibility.
Font Sizes: Establish a clear hierarchy with larger sizes for headings and smaller sizes for body text to organize content effectively.

## Grids & Layouts

The grid helps us achieve visual balance and makes the user interface easier to scan. With the grid we can create consistent layouts that work across devices, screen sizes, and environments.

### Grid anatomy
Grids in CloudSEK Design System contain columns (1), gutters (2), and margins (3).

<img src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=1656BB0C87C6BA8%21258016&authkey=%21APhT1HUypnaVsrc&width=1520&height=903" width="1520" height="903" />


### Coloumns
Columns define the areas of a design that contain content. The column widths are defined by percentages, and will resize based on the viewport. The number of columns available will also be affected by the viewport. A general rule of thumb is to allow the content to determine the breakpoints and how many columns to show at each viewport size.

### Gutters
Gutters are fixed-width spacing between columns that separate content. We use our space tokens to define the gutters for the grid.

### Margins
Margins separate content from the left and right edges of the grid. Margins are fixed-width and defined by using our space tokens. In general, wider margins are more suited for larger screens. Margins should either be the same width, or wider than the gutter width.

### Applying the Grid
CloudSEK Design System offers options for customizing the grid. We support up to 12 column layouts that can be fixed or fluid.

### Layout across columns
Content can span multiple columns or use a subset of columns in a grid.

### Gutter and margin spacing
We offer three types of spacing for gutters and margins: S, L, and XL. These options align with our space tokens. Typically, larger spacing makes sense on larger screens.

## Typography
We use the following typographic scale to communicate visual hierarchy in text and to create a predictable sizing for headers and text content. Our typographic scale is purposefully harmonious with our spacing scale. The base font-size is 14px - 1rem.
