# Creating a custom HTML canvas library for Manifesto

| Phase | Description | Challenges | Solutions |
|-------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Development | Development of a custom HTML Canvas library for creating sophisticated UI graphs with double donut layers and customized user interactions. | Achieving high levels of customization and interactivity within the constraints of HTML Canvas. | Adopted iterative development, aligning functionalities closely with reference designs and refining based on feedback. |
| Results and Evaluation | Successful completion of the development phase in two weeks, followed by rigorous testing for performance and reliability. | Case 1: Loading the graph with 4 elements for comparison and hover interaction. Case 2: Loading the graph with 11 elements for comparison and hover interaction. | Ensured the graph's performance and reliability through testing and adjustments. |

The project started upon while I was part of the Vanenburg team centered around a unique and 
challenging requirement: to create a sophisticated UI graph characterized by double donut layers, 
alongside customized user interactions. This necessity arose from the realization that neither 
open-source nor commercial graph libraries available at the time could meet the specific demands 
of our project. My confidence in leveraging HTML Canvas and JavaScript for the development of 
custom graph components led to my assignment to this task.

## Development, Results and Evaluation
The development phase culminated successfully after two weeks, followed by a rigorous testing phase 
to ensure the graph's performance and reliability.

## Challenges and Solutions
One of the main challenges encountered during the development phase was achieving the desired level 
of customization and interactivity within the constraints of HTML Canvas. To overcome this, I used a 
process of iterative development, closely aligning the graph's functionalities with the reference 
designs and continuously refining the implementation based on feedback and testing results.
