# Johnu Marattil — Senior UX/UI Designer

**Toronto, ON | [johnumarattil@gmail.com](mailto:johnumarattil@gmail.com)**

Senior UX/UI Designer with **7+ years of experience** in enterprise-scale web and mobile applications. I design **intuitive solutions** that transform complex user journeys into seamless experiences. With expertise in delivering end to end designs for XVigil, BeVigil, Neeto Products, Maqqie, and HealthChart, I combine design thinking methodology with technical implementation to create products that solve real business problems.

My approach merges **user research and technical execution**, delivering end-to-end solutions from wireframing to production-ready code. I specialize in creating enterprise-grade interfaces that balance aesthetic appeal with functional performance. Currently pursuing a **Master of Digital Media** at Toronto Metropolitan University.

## What I Do Best

I love creating experiences that make complex systems feel simple and intuitive. My toolkit includes:

- **Research & Strategy** — Understanding user needs deeply through analytics, journey mapping, and information architecture. I believe in data-driven decisions and the power of A/B testing to validate assumptions.

- **Design & Development** — Bringing ideas to life with Figma and Adobe Creative Cloud. From wireframes to interactive prototypes, I craft experiences that resonate with users while solving business challenges.

- **Code & Implementation** — Translating designs into reality using React, NextJS, TypeScript, and modern CSS techniques. I enjoy the technical aspects of bringing designs to life, including animations and responsive layouts.

- **Accessibility & Systems** — Creating component libraries and design systems that ensure consistency and accessibility. I'm committed to WCAG and AODA standards to make digital experiences inclusive for everyone.

I'm equally comfortable with web and mobile platforms, having worked across both throughout my career.

## My Journey

My formal education includes a **Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering** from MG University, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge through a **Master of Digital Media** program at Toronto Metropolitan University.

Over the past 7+ years, I've had the opportunity to shape digital experiences across various industries:

At **Aquarius Consulting**, I redesigned HealthChart's patient management system for Harrison Healthcare, making it significantly more intuitive for healthcare professionals. The redesign led to a 40% jump in user engagement—a testament to how good design can transform complex workflows.

With **Bigbinary Solutions**, I contributed to the design of a UI Kit for Neeto productivity apps that cut development handoff time by 30%. This taught me the immense value of design systems in maintaining consistency across complex product ecosystems.

My time at **CloudSEK** was particularly rewarding, where I led UX design for cybersecurity platforms that secured a 5-star Gartner rating and $7M in Series A funding. I enjoyed mentoring junior designers and seeing how our work directly impacted business outcomes.

I began my career at **Vanenburg Software** (now Rappit), developing UI flows for hybrid applications and creating data visualizations. This foundation in front-end development has proven invaluable throughout my career, allowing me to bridge the gap between design and implementation.

## Continuous Learning

I believe in lifelong learning and have invested in my growth through certifications in Emotional Intelligence, Interactive Learning, Graphic Design Foundations, and Design Thinking methodologies.

## Beyond Design

When I'm not designing digital experiences, I volunteer as a driver for the **Canada Cancer Society**, helping patients reach their treatment centers around Toronto. This work has deepened my understanding of empathy and reinforced the importance of human-centered design in everything I create.
